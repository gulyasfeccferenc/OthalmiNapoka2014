    		Dear Pulilab,<br><br>
I would like to apply for SummerHack in Budapest intership.<br><br>
I am currently studying Engineering Information Technology (it is my first year in BSc) at the University of Szeged and already ended with Webdeveloping in practice course in the II. semester.<br>
I met web development in that course first, but did not take much time to fell in love with it. At first we had fought against the Kingdom of Javascript, then defeated the jQueries. After that we dive into Python and I am already shocked what a powerfull language it is with his friend, Django.<br>
I would like the opportunity to meet with you to discuss any internship openings you might have. Please let me know if you have any questions. I just created a simple page(http://gulyasfeccferenc.github.io/about.html) where you can grab as many information about me as you want. You can reach me everytime by phone at +36205101716 or by email at gulyasfeccferenc@gmail.com .<br><br>

Thank you for your consideration.<br>
Sincerely,
Gulyás Ferenc
